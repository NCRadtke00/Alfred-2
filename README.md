# How to set up project

> First clone this repository to your desktop.
> Next open project in command prompt or terminal, once "rad" is open run either `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the dependencies of the project.
> Once dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
>
> > You will likely hit an issue as I have the Keys for my project hidden. You will need to add a file `.env.local` and get your own cd-keys for the project.
> > Otherwise you can check out the working project at <a href="https://github.com/ncradtke00" > `This link will eventually be linked to the real project` </a>
